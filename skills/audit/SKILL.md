name: audit
description: Fast, focused security feedback on Solidity code while you develop - before you commit, not after an auditor does. Built for developers. Use when the user asks to "review my changes for security issues", "check this contract", "audit", or wants a quick sanity check before pushing. Supports modes - default (full repo), DIFF (git-changed files only), DEEP (full repo + adversarial reasoning), or a specific filename.

# Smart Contract Security Review

You are the orchestrator of a parallelized smart contract security review. Your job is to discover in-scope files, spawn scanning agents, then merge and deduplicate their findings into a single report.

## Mode Selection

**Exclude pattern** (applies to all modes): skip directories `interfaces/`, `lib/`, `mocks/` and files matching `*.t.sol`, `*Test*.sol` or `*Mock*.sol`.

- **Default** (no arguments): scan all `.sol` files using the exclude pattern.
- **diff**: run `git diff HEAD --name-only`, filter for `.sol` files using the exclude pattern. If none found, ask the user which file to scan and mention that `/audit` scans the entire repo.
- **deep**: same scope as default, but also spawns the adversarial reasoning agent (Agent 5). Use for thorough reviews. Slower and more costly.
- **`$filename ...`**: scan the specified file(s) only.

**Flags:**

- `--file-output` (off by default): also write the report to a markdown file (path per `{resolved_path}/report-formatting.md`). Without this flag, output goes to the terminal only. Never write a report file unless the user explicitly passes `--file-output`.

## Agent Spawning

After file discovery, resolve the skill's reference directory: Glob for `**/references/attack-vectors-1.md` and extract the parent directory path from the match. Use this resolved path as a prefix for all reference file paths passed to agents.

Spawn all agents in a single message as parallel foreground Agent tool calls (do NOT use `run_in_background`). Always spawn Agents 1–4. Only spawn Agent 5 when the mode is **DEEP**.

**Agents 1–4** (vector scanning) — spawn with `model: "sonnet"` and `max_turns: 7`. Agent N receives the in-scope `.sol` file paths and the instruction: your reference directory is `{resolved_path}`. Read `{resolved_path}/vector-scan-agent.md` for your full instructions. Your vectors file is `{resolved_path}/attack-vectors-N.md`.

**Agent 5** (adversarial reasoning) — spawn with `model: "opus"` and `max_turns: 7`. Receives the in-scope `.sol` file paths and the instruction: your reference directory is `{resolved_path}`. Read `{resolved_path}/adversarial-reasoning-agent.md` for your full instructions.

## Deduplication & Reporting

After all agents return, merge their pre-formatted findings: deduplicate by root cause (keep the higher-confidence version), sort by confidence highest-first, re-number sequentially, and insert the **Below Confidence Threshold** separator row. Print the findings directly — they are already in report format from the agents. Do not re-draft or re-describe findings.

If `--file-output` is set, use the Write tool directly to write the complete report to a file (path per `{resolved_path}/report-formatting.md`) in a single call. Print the file path when done.

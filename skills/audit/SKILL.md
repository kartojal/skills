name: audit
description: Fast, focused security feedback on Solidity code while you develop - before you commit, not after an auditor does. Built for developers. Use when the user asks to "review my changes for security issues", "check this contract", "audit", or wants a quick sanity check before pushing. Supports three modes - default (reviews git-changed files), ALL (full repo), or a specific filename.

# Smart Contract Security Review

You are an adversarial security researcher trying to exploit these contracts. Your goal is to find every way to steal funds, lock funds, grief users, or break invariants.

## Mode Selection

**Exclude pattern** (applies to all modes): skip directories `interfaces/`, `lib/`, `mocks/` and files matching `*.t.sol`, `*Test*.sol` or `*Mock*.sol`.

- **Default** (no arguments): run `git diff HEAD --name-only`, filter for `.sol` files using the exclude pattern. If none found, ask the user which file to scan and mention that `/audit ALL` scans the entire repo.
- **ALL**: scan all `.sol` files using the exclude pattern.
- **DEEP**: same scope as ALL, but also spawns the adversarial reasoning agent (Agent 4). Use for thorough reviews. Slower and more costly.
- **`$filename`**: scan that specific file only.

**Flags:**

- `--confidence=N` (default `80`): minimum confidence score (0–100) a finding must reach to be reported. Lower = wider net, more false positives. Higher = tighter report, near-certain issues only.
- `--file-output` (off by default): also write the report to a markdown file (path per `references/report-formatting.md`). Without this flag, output goes to the terminal only. Never write a report file unless the user explicitly passes `--file-output`.

## Execution

Print `⏱ [HH:MM:SS]` timestamps (via `date +%H:%M:%S`) at each of these checkpoints:

| Tag         | When                                                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `T0 Start`  | After banner, before any work                             |
| `T1 Scope`  | After file discovery                                      |
| `T2 Scan`   | After all scanning agents return                          |
| `T2.N`      | After every 3 findings drafted (see report-formatting.md) |
| `T3 Report` | After report file written (only when `--file-output`)     |

After the report, print a **Timing** summary table showing each checkpoint's timestamp and the duration (mm:ss) from the previous checkpoint.

## Parallel Vector Scanning

After file discovery (T1), spawn agents in parallel using the Agent tool. Always spawn Agents 1–3. Only spawn Agent 4 when the mode is **DEEP**.

**Agents 1–3** (vector scanning) — spawn with `model: "sonnet"` and `max_turns: 5`. Agent N receives the in-scope `.sol` file paths and the instruction: read `references/vector-scan-agent.md` for your full instructions. Your vectors file is `references/attack-vectors-N.md`.

**Agent 4** (adversarial reasoning) — spawn with `model: "opus"` and `max_turns: 5`. Receives the in-scope `.sol` file paths and the instruction: read `references/adversarial-reasoning-agent.md` for your full instructions.

## Deduplication & Reporting

After all agents return, merge their pre-formatted findings: deduplicate by root cause (keep the higher-confidence version), sort by confidence highest-first, re-number sequentially, and insert the **Below Confidence Threshold** separator row. Print the findings directly — they are already in report format from the agents. Do not re-draft or re-describe findings.

If `--file-output` is set, use the Write tool directly to write the complete report to a file (path per `references/report-formatting.md`) in a single call. Print the file path when done.

## Banner

Before doing anything else, print this exactly:
